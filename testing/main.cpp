//Notes

//Testing
/*Testing is used in larger programs, Manual Verification is used in small programs
 *Types
 *  Unit testing: Testing individual parts like functions, classes, structs, and algorithms.
 *      Ex.
 *  Integration testing: Testing integrated modules of a system.
 *  Functional testing: Testing to see of features have met functional requirements.
 *  System testing: Testing against the overall system's requirements
 *  End-To-End Testing: A type of system testing, during which the app is treated as the live functioning system.
 *  Acceptance Testing: Testing done by the customer to see if it meets their requirements
 *Using: Creating a shortcut of sorts to define a variable
 *  using my_int = int; (Used more than type defining)
 *Type defining: typedef int my_int; (Used in the older versions of C++) */
